## Prerequisites

---

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

You will need at least:

- a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS version (`>= 14.17.3`)
- a package manager. This tuto will use `yarn` (`>= 1.22.10`) but it might also work with `npm` (`>= 6.14.13`)
- a [Ledger Device](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison) (Nano S or X). You will need one to access Ledger Live. 

Even though this tutorial will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the boilerplate app, it's not a prerequisite for this tutorial.
