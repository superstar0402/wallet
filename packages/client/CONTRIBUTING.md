## JavaScript styleguide

- ES6+ features.
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting convention. Check `yarn format:check`.
- ESLint is used to enhance code quality. Check with `yarn lint:check`.
- TypeScript is used to typecheck the library. Check with `yarn build`.

> NB. for the 3 points above, the best is to have integration of Prettier,
> ESlint, Flowtype in your text editor (there are plugin for most editors).
