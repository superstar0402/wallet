# Welcome to the Wallet API Documentation ðŸš€

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for developing Live Apps within Ledger Live. Ledger Live is a state-of-the-art application that connects users to the decentralized world through their Ledger hardware wallets. As a developer, you have the unique opportunity to build innovative decentralized applications (dApps) that can be embedded directly within Ledger Live, thereby providing users a seamless and secure experience.

Our documentation is divided into several sections, each dedicated to different aspects of Live App development:

## Sections

### [React](./react)

This section is dedicated to developers who want to leverage the power of React in their Live Apps. It includes a React library which offers a set of hooks and utilities for connecting your Live App to Ledger wallets with ease. This section covers everything from setting up your environment to using various hooks for account management, signing transactions, and more.

### [Core](./core)

If you're looking to use plain JavaScript without the abstractions provided by React, the Core section is for you. It contains a vanilla JS library that allows you to interact with Ledger hardware wallets. This section includes guides and references for setting up and utilizing the Core library.

### [Manifest](./manifest)

Manifests are an essential part of Live Apps, as they define how your Live App interacts with Ledger Live. In the Manifest section, you'll learn how to write manifests for your Live Apps. This section covers the structure, properties, and validation of manifests.
