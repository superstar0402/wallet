# Welcome to Ledger Live Apps Documentation ðŸš€

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for developing Live Apps within Ledger Live using the Wallet API. By leveraging the Wallet API, you can build and integrate your application seamlessly into Ledger Live, providing users with a secure and streamlined experience.

## What is a Live App?

A Live App is an application that is integrated directly into Ledger Live. It enables users to interact with blockchain technologies securely through their Ledger hardware wallets without leaving Ledger Live.
